# File Robber (BETA)
A Batch Script that copies specified folders and files to a folder or USB Drive. This app's purpose is to quickly copy the victim's important files to a USB drive or folder. It can also do a number of things such as save any passwords on the system to the USB Drive, or set up a remote connection to the victim's computer. 
**THIS IS STILL IN BETA!!**

## Features
### Unplug Guard
Unplug Guard protects the copying files and the USB drive in case of unplug by the victim.
If the device is unplugged, upon replug, the script will continue and repair any corrupted files.
