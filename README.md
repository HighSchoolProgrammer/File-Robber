# USB File Robber (BETA)
A Batch Script that copies specified folders and files to USB Drive. It can also do a number of things such as save any passwords on the system to the USB Drive, or set up a remote connection to the victim's computer.
**THIS IS STILL IN BETA!!**

## Features
### Unplug Guard
Unplug Guard protects the copying files and the USB drive in case of unplug by the victim.
If the device is unplugged, upon replug, the script will continue and repair any corrupted files.

### Cloud Scan
Cloud Scan detects any cloud service and copies the files from the cloud as well as the local files.
NOTE: Currently only works with OneDrive

## Upcoming Features
- Version checker that auto-runs with the script to ensure that you are running the latest version.
- Auto update via script
- Add Cloud Scan functionality for Google Drive
- Add Cloud Scan functionality for Dropbox
- Plugins (basically making extra optional features that can be installed seperately)
- Onboarding Setup Built-in
- Custom Installer (No iexpress installer)
- GitHub Wiki
- Better UI (VBS)
- Better File/Folder Organisation
- Add back USB Autorun (Low chance because AutoRun was discontinued in Windows 7)
- Change Scripting to Python (Very low chance as this program is built natively in batchfile)
